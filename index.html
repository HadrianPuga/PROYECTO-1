  <p>These are two of the most popular meals of the spanish gastronomy, the first the potato omelette or Spanish omelette is an egg shake to which chopped potatoes are added. And the second, the "pulpo á feira" is a traditional Galician dish and a staple in its gastronomy, although its consumption has been generalized throughout Spain. It is a festive dish made with whole cooked octopus, simply seasoned with oil, "pimentón" and salt, and almost always accompanied with cooked potatoes.
